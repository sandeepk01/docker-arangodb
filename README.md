# Docker ArangoDB
ArangoDB is a distributed open-source database with a flexible data model for documents, graphs, and key-values. You can build high performance applications using a convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript extensions.

The official image is based on Alpine which might give you performance issue when doing I/O intensive operations, hence this customisation was desired.
